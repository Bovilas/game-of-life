The Game of Life, also known as Conway's Game of Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a "zero-player game".
I always loved messing around in it on other webapps, so when i needed to think up a game project, i thought i'd remake this.
Includes a simple menu, ability to save and load "progress" and logs.
